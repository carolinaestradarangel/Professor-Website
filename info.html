What I really want to highlight with my code would be the schedule section, I gave specifics to the user to not get confused, but to further specify if the user enters 07 (do not include anything else)into the textbox then it should result in professors names. The reason for the 0 to be in the front is because there are other times like 17 and my code will take that a valid response to execute and give a professor name that isn't in the correct time. I chose to keep the military time from the information that was webscrapped just to be concise with my code and I did give that reference to not have to look up the conversion in case it was not known. With my submit button, I used the same style the professor demonstrated in class with the information being executed in another place, not a webpage I created, so I didn't really know how to give a link to go back to the homepage, but the results would be given. Overall, I used a lot of lists as a way to webscrape the website and get the information seperately and decided it was best to seperate the name, email, and schedule in the json file because I was able to get the names through indexing the email or schedule. As I mentioned in one of my comments, this link can be a bit glitchy because you can click on this about section to read about my code, but it doesn't seem to always want to move to other links or go back to the code section, but all links work when it was ran. I really enjoyed this whole process with coding, definitely made me think about the whole website and webscraping!
